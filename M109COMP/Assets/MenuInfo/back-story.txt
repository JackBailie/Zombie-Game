 It was a normal Friday afternoon, everything was quiet apart from the birds chirping when all of a sudden a large earthquake occured.  Over the horizon appeared a large army of the undead, charging headfirst towards the city.  A mass panic ensued as the citezens of the city met their passed reletives in the way they least expected and least wanted.  One of these citezens was Rick, at the time of the attack he was in his 9 to 5 office job typing away.  As soon as Rick saw the horde attempting to enter the office he dashed to the parking garage and hopped in his Nissan Micra.  Ricks main concern was reaching his family in the town of "Newtownards", however Rick was in "Bangor".  Rick would therefore have to endure a harsh journey through the arid "Bangor Carriageway" to reach his loved ones, but it would be worth the hassle.

 After 3 rough days of driving through the "Bangor Carriageway" Ricks motor was running out petrol and thus began to chug, after half a mile the engine gave up with one final clunk.  In frustration Rick slammed his head off the steering wheel when he then remembered the equipment in his boot which was perfect for this situation.  Rick decided to walk the rest of the journey despite the fact that "Newtownards" was still 40 miles away.  The man lifted an AKM, glock 17, knife and a flashlight out of the boot of his car and began marching towards newtownards.  After about 5 hours of walking Rick began to have flashbacks of the day the zombies attacked, while overthinking the whole ordeal he found himself within a horde of zombies.  Luckily the zombies had not noticed the young man unintentionally infiltrate their ranks.  In Rick's fury he decided that the best means of escape would be to kill all of the zombies, so he loaded his guns and began to take aim.
